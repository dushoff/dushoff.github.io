\subsection*{Notes on intervention speed}

Renewal equation.

$$i_s(t) = i(s) \Rx S(t) g(t-s)$$

$$i(t) = \int{i(s) \Rx S(t) g(t-s)} ds$$

We imagine an invading disease with kernel $k(\tau) = \Rx g(\tau)$. 
$g(\tau)$ is the ``intrinsic'' generation interval, and \Rx\ is the effective reproductive number.

The exponential rate of spread $r$ is given by:

\begin{equation}
	\int{k(\tau)) \exp(-r\tau) d\tau} = 1
\end{equation}

Now define $b_0(\tau) = k(\tau)) \exp(-r\tau) d\tau$. This is a distribution (since it integrates to 1), and is in fact the backward generation distribution during the exponential growth phase.
