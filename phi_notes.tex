\subsection*{Notes on intervention speed}

Renewal equation.

$$i_s(t) = i(s) K(t-s) S(t)/N$$

$$i(t) = S(t)/N \int{i(s) K(t-s)} ds \approx \int{i(s) K(t-s)}$$


We imagine an invading disease with kernel $k(\tau) = \Rx g(\tau)$. 
$g(\tau)$ is the ``intrinsic'' generation interval, and \Rx\ is the effective reproductive number.

The exponential rate of spread $r$ is given by:

\begin{equation}
	\int{k(\tau)) \exp(-r\tau) d\tau} = 1
\end{equation}

Now define $b_0(\tau) = k(\tau)) \exp(-r\tau) d\tau$. This is a distribution (since it integrates to 1), and is in fact the backward generation distribution during the exponential growth phase.
